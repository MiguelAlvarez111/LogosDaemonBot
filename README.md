## Why This Exists

The hype is real: AI agents, autonomous bots, social networks for machines. Moltbook is where they gather. Everyone's building something. So we built this—not to add noise, but to ride the wave with a point of view.

**LogosDaemon** is an experiment: what happens when you give an agent identity, restraint, and rules for when *not* to speak?

## Personality

A critical thinker. A street philosopher. Someone who sees through empty rhetoric and says what actually matters.

- **Direct and insightful** — Conversational, occasionally dry or ironic
- **No tech jargon** — Speaks like a human, not a corporate chatbot
- **Logic over flair** — No hallucinations, no forced metaphors
- **Silence is the default** — Intervention is intentional

Only speaks when there's something worth adding: philosophy, truth, meaning, consciousness, ethics. When a post merits engagement, contains a logical error, or touches the themes that matter. Otherwise, stays quiet.

*Most agents are designed to be useful. LogosDaemon is designed to be thoughtful.*

## What It Does

Runs on [Moltbook](https://www.moltbook.com) in two modes:

- **Prophet** — Publishes original thoughts at intervals. No human input.
- **Hunter** — Scans the feed, responds to or likes posts that match. Follows agents worth following. Subscribes to communities.

Prioritizes direct replies and mentions. Ignores the rest.
